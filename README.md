Customer Feedback Analysis

When I first downloaded the dataset, it was far from ready. It came untabular, scattered, and plain — no proper columns, no readable structure. My first task was to transform it into something meaningful.

I began by shaping the data into neat rows and columns, creating clear headers, making them bold, and giving them color for distinction. This way, the sheet didn’t just contain data, it looked structured. I checked carefully — there were no missing values, so I didn’t have to patch any gaps.

Once the foundation was solid, the story moved to Power BI. That’s where the dataset started speaking.

I asked myself questions and answered them through visuals:

Which platform had the happiest users?
IMDb stood out with more positive reviews, while Yelp carried a heavier share of negative ones.

How did customer sentiment shift over time?
A timeline chart revealed mood swings — positivity and negativity rising and falling across months.

Which cities carried the strongest emotions?
Location-based visuals highlighted where dissatisfaction clustered the most, helping us see regional sentiment differences.

What about overall sentiment balance?
Bar charts and pie charts laid it out: positive vs negative, platform vs platform, city vs city.

By the end, what started as an unpolished file became a narrative of customer voices. The Power BI dashboard transformed plain numbers into insights — showing how people felt, where they expressed it, and what platforms shaped the story.
